## Overview

The AnswerrAI Chat Completion API gives you seamless access to the world's leading AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) through a **unified** **interface**. Stop juggling multiple API integrations - **one endpoint**, all the AI power you need.

In today's fragmented AI landscape, developers waste countless hours maintaining separate integrations for each AI provider. AnswerrAI eliminates this complexity, letting you focus on building exceptional experiences rather than managing API connections.

Our API helps unlock the full potential of models with advanced features like streaming responses, context management, and detailed token analytics to optimize your costs.

## Base URL

```javascript
https://api.answerr.ai/v1
```

## Authentication

All requests require your API key in the header. Keep it safe, keep it secret.

```javascript
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

We use industry-standard authentication to protect your account. Your API key grants access to powerful AI capabilities, so we recommend storing it securely in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your application.

## Choosing Your AI Model

We've simplified model selection while giving you maximum flexibility. Access the latest and legacy models from:

| Provider  | Available Models                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI    | GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo                             |
| Anthropic | Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 2 |
| Google    | Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra                                 |

Simply specify your model of choice in the request. No need to maintain multiple API keys or learn different request formats.

Each model has unique strengths - OpenAI excels at coding and structured outputs, Claude shines with nuanced understanding of complex instructions, and Gemini offers exceptional reasoning capabilities. 

# Chat Completion Endpoint

## Create a Chat Completion

Endpoint: `POST /chat/completions`

Send your prompts, get AI-powered responses instantly.

Unlike traditional APIs that simply process and return data, chat completions generate human-like responses to natural language inputs. This makes them ideal for conversational interfaces, content generation, and creative assistance.

**Request Body:**

```javascript
{
  "model": "gpt-4o",            // Choose any supported model
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
    }
  ],
  "stream": true,               // Get tokens as they're generated
  "temperature": 0.7,           // Control creativity vs determinism
  "max_tokens": 1000,           // Control response length
  "top_p": 0.95,                // Alternative to temperature
  "frequency_penalty": 0.0,     // Reduce repetition
  "presence_penalty": 0.0       // Encourage new topics
}
```

**Response (non-streaming):**

```javascript
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-7QyqpwdfHqwajicIEznoc6Q47XAyF",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1685707255,
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Quantum computing is like having a super-powered calculator that can consider multiple possibilities at once. While regular computers use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or 'qubits' that can exist in multiple states simultaneouslyâ€”imagine a coin that's both heads AND tails until you look at it.\n\nThis unique property allows quantum computers to solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers, such as breaking encryption codes or simulating molecules for drug discovery. However, they're extremely difficult to build and maintain because quantum states are very fragile and easily disrupted by their environment."
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 28,
    "completion_tokens": 124,
    "total_tokens": 152
  }
}
```

**Streaming Responses**

When stream: true, the response comes as a series of chunks, allowing for real-time display. Each chunk contains a piece of the generated response:

```javascript
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-7QyrQcd6NhzFpQ9hGWVRZsxMSMJGS","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1685707297,"model":"gpt-4o","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":"Quantum"},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-7QyrQcd6NhzFpQ9hGWVRZsxMSMJGS","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1685707297,"model":"gpt-4o","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" computing"},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-7QyrQcd6NhzFpQ9hGWVRZsxMSMJGS","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1685707297,"model":"gpt-4o","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" is"},"finish_reason":null}]}

// ... more chunks ...

data: [DONE]
```

Streaming transforms user experience by creating the illusion of the AI "thinking" in real-time. This reduces perceived latency and increases engagement - users stay connected to your application instead of waiting for a complete response. For applications like customer service bots or educational tools, this immediate feedback loop builds trust and enhances user satisfaction.

**Context Management**

Your conversations don't exist in a vacuum. Our API intelligently manages conversation context across multiple exchanges, letting you build truly interactive experiences:

```javascript
// First message
const response1 = await answerr.createChatCompletion({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet",
  messages: [
    { 
      role: "user", 
      content: "What's the capital of France?" 
    }
  ]
});
// "The capital of France is Paris."

// Follow-up without repeating context
const response2 = await answerr.createChatCompletion({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet",
  messages: [
    { 
      role: "user", 
      content: "What's the capital of France?" 
    },
    { 
      role: "assistant", 
      content: "The capital of France is Paris." 
    },
    { 
      role: "user", 
      content: "Tell me about its famous tower." 
    }
  ]
});
// "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower..."
```

Our API maintains the thread of discussion, enabling:

- Natural follow-up questions without restating context
- Progressive exploration of complex topics
- Personalized experiences that build on previous interactions
- Long-running assistants that remember user preferences and history

For applications like customer support, educational tools, or virtual assistants, this continuity creates more engaging, efficient interactions that keep users coming back.

# Reliability and Performance

When integrating AI into mission-critical applications, reliability isn't optional. AnswerrAI's infrastructure is built for enterprise-grade dependability:

- Global edge network ensuring low latency worldwide
- Automatic failover between model providers during outages
- Intelligent request routing to optimize response times
- Horizontal scaling to handle traffic spikes without degradation

Our architecture allows you to build AI-powered applications that perform consistently even under heavy load, across geographic regions, and during provider outages.

# Error Handling

When something goes wrong, you'll know exactly why:

```javascript
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_model",
    "message": "The model 'gpt-5' does not exist.",
    "param": "model",
    "type": "invalid_request_error"
  }
}
```

Common status codes:

`400`: Invalid request (check your parameters)

`401`: Invalid API key

`404`: Endpoint not found

`429`: Rate limit exceeded

`500`: Server error (contact support)
